## About

Cut the Virus is a **puzzle game** where the player controls the white blood cell with a purpose of eliminating the viruses. The player can **cut through** the viruses by pointing the end position for the cell. There are some **obstacles,** such as the blood and fat cells. The blood cells can be cut through, which results in a **penalty**. There are **12 levels** in total. Each level has a **time limit** and a **rating** based on the penalty. The lack of the penalty results in a full score.
